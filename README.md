# Webtoon Image Segmentation and In-Painting for Text

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive suite of tools and implementations for image segmentation and in-painting, specifically tailored for webtoon images. It automates and refines the process of removing text from webtoon panels and restoring the underlying images, making it invaluable for webtoon translation and localization projects.

## Features

### Mask Dataset Generation
- Utilizes ImageMagick to compare clean and original webtoon panels.
- Automatically generates masks for text areas, facilitating the creation of a model that can produce these masks independently.

### COCO Dataset Conversion
- Processes comparison data into COCO dataset format, providing a standardized way to handle and analyze image segmentation data.

### Synthetic Dataset Generator
- Capable of creating synthetic combinations of text data and labels using image text and panels.
- Enhances the robustness of the mask generation model by providing diverse training data.

### Mask Generation
- Located in the `Mask_Generation` directory.
- Employs a custom-trained Mask2Former model for accurate segmentation mask generation.

### Inpainting
- Found in the `inpaint` directory.
- Uses masks generated by the Mask2Former model to seamlessly inpaint text sections of webtoons.
